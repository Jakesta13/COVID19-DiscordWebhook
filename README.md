# COVID19 to Discord Webhook
I created this simple script since I was bored at home, I thought it might be useful for others.

Depending on the country selected, messages sent could be slower or faster.

## Features
* Displays current infections
* Displays difference since last update

## Note
This script does not give the webhook a name or change it's avatar ... I may change that in the future.








Stay Safe
